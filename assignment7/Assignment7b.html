                    I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip!

                    Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? When will that be? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
